# ministd

A minimal `std` replacement for bootstrapping OftLisp.
Note that ministd is not a strict subset of std, and should not be treated as a general-purpose replacement.

Notably, it does not provide any macros.
Functions that normally exist as a variadic macro version and a fixed-arity function version are usually defined with a fixed arity.
